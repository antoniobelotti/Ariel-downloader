# Ariel downloader

Chrome/chromium extension to download every document or video on any (currently open) ariel.ctu.unimi.it page with a single click.

## Manual installation:

+ enable developer option on browsername://extensions
+ clone the repo 
+ click on "install unpackaged extension" from the browsername://extensions page
+ select root folder of the repo

The extensions is not signed and not verified by the chrome store, so **the browser may/will complain at every restart**.

It may be useful to set the browser download directory to a custom folder in order to avoid a mess in the default download folder.

It's a toy project; code is messy <sub>(and probably buggy <sub>and can brake if they change a couple of css selectors on the site)<sub>
